# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## The Challenge:

Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.



## Project Conduction:
As a freelance web developer, I want to generate a simple logo for my projects - so that I don't have to pay a graphic designer.



## Technology Stack:
- node.js
- node inquirer Package
- node jest Package
- node inquirer-maxlength-input-prompt

- Screencastify 
- Google Drive



## Acceptance Criteria:
- When the user engages with the command-line application that accepts user input, they are prompted for text and can enter up to three characters.

- When the user is prompted for the text color, they can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).

- When the user is prompted for a shape, they are presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.

- When the user is prompted for the shape's color, they can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).

- When they have entered input for all the prompts, a SVG file is created named `logo.svg` and the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line.

- When the user opens the `logo.svg` file in a browser they are shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered.



## Mock-Up

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated SVG given the following input entered by the user: 
- `MON` for the text, 
- `black` for the text color, 
- `Hexagon` from the list of shapes,
- `light pink` for the shape color

Note that this is just an image of the output SVG and not the SVG file itself:
